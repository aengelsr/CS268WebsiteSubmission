       <h1>Expectations</h1>
Your site must meet the following expectations:

You will create a website for a client of your choosing. Your client could be a family member, a business, a student group, a friend, an online community, and so on. The only restriction is that the client cannot be just you.
Your site's webpages must include some sort of headers.
Your site must contain at least ten separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. 
Your site's webpages must include some sort of navigation links.
Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens. For instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens. You are encouraged to implement separate layouts using CSS media queries.
Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Global style rules must be placed in a shared stylesheet. Individual pages’ style rules must be placed in a separate stylesheets.
Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.
Each page must declare its favicon.
Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. CSS files must be placed in a directory named css. 
Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party tools.
Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s HTML validator (Links to an external site.) and CSS validator (Links to an external site.).
Your site could be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with your instructor. On GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, share with the user gomesr-uwec.(Not required for this project but recommended)
The names of your files should be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.
Your content should be neatly aligned. The axes should be clearly visible.
Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font.
Your site must include links to external sites. Clicking on external links must open a new tab or window rather than replace your page.
Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for classes and IDs.
Your site's webpages should include a consistent navbar. 
Your site's webpages should include some sort of header and footer section along with the navbar. 
Your site's webpages should implement flexboxes/grids or a combination of both.

        <h1>Outcomes</h1>
        the way we met the expections of this project was by meeting all basic expectations such as client,
        pages, headers, distinct layouts for different screen sizes, a coherent style, images that have the alt
        feature when they don't load, filing name is correct, use of grid and flex boxes, and a navbar, with headers and footers on each page. 

        We also made the website primilary with HTML and CSS with a little bit of javascript for some functions.

        We used github to keep all our code together in one place sp we could work together.

        We also used the W3C's HTML and CSS validator to make sure our code was correct and had no errors.

        <h1>Client Thoughts</h1>
        We talked with our client and she seemed to be really happy with the design and layout choices we made
        for her website. She also liked the color scheme and the way we used the images she gave us. There were a few 
        things she did not like, such as some of the fonts used and the way we had the gallery page layed out. In the future
        She would like to see a different font and a different layout for the gallery page with info about each picture
        presented. 

        We also asked her if she would like to see anything else on the website and she said she would like to see a 
        book circle page were followers can chat about the book of the week.
